The model determines the start of the flight period for the 1st and 2nd generation of carrot rust fly based on accumuleted degree-days (day-degrees) over a base temperature of 5,0 °C. VIPS uses the model for the 1st generation only. \nStandard air temperature (temperature measured 2 m above ground) is used in the model. Degree-days are defined for this model as the sum of the difference between a base temperature of 5,0 °C and the mean temperature for all days with a temperature >5,0 °C, in other words (daily mean temperature – 5,0 °C) from 1 March (beginning when the ground has thawed).\n",
