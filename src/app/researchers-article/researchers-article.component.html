      <h2>Researchers</h2>
      <img class="article-image" src="img/research.png">
      Researchers are invited to use IPM Decisions Platform and dashboards to improve existing pest DSS tools by
      adapting existing models from other regions/countries to suit the situation in their region/country by modifying
      the internal parameters of models underpinning the DSS tools without the need for programming skills (where these
      parameters have been made accessible).
      <br><br>
      They will be able to rapidly test and evaluate these novel DSS combinations against current DSS tools using the
      data sources and data manipulation algorithms available through Platform.
      <br><br>
      This online Platform will, for the first time, link existing DSS and input data across European actors. The
      Platform will consist of a central web server and a set of web services (dashboard manager, DSS manager and Data
      manager). The central server will act as a repository containing DSS information, data information, application
      programming interfaces (APIs), and source code. This will include web services used to manage the Dashboards and
      their information requirements, widgets and snippets (small pieces of computer code that provide core
      functionality such as visualisation via maps, graphs and tables, or forms for user input) used in the Dashboards,
      Dashboard web page designs and tools for DSS evaluation, adaptation and development. Generic enablers from the
      Open Source FIWARE catalogue will be selected, integrated and customized, as building blocks to create
      applications.
